First lets create an example lookup table to use. this can be done in the S1 UI in the "Configuration Tables" section: https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000006442

however they can also be created via the savelookup command, which I will use just to keep everything in powerquery


| let myvalue=1 , mysecondvalue=2
| limit 2
| savelookup 'testsavedlookup'


run this in powerquery and it will create a lookup table, which looks like this:

{
  "columnNames": ["myvalue", "mysecondvalue"],
  "rows": [
    [1, 2],
    [1, 2]
  ]
}


and then here is an example command to retrieve a value from said table

| let matching_value_in_existing_query=1
| limit 1
| lookup value_retrived_from_lookup=mysecondvalue from 'testsavedlookup' by myvalue=matching_value_in_existing_query

I'm creating a new field named "matching_value_in_existign_query" and setting it be equal to 1
limiting my table to 1 row (just to make things simple / reduce processing power) 
and then I am taking the value, checking it against the colunn "myvalue" in the lookup table. 
if/when that matches, then I am extracting the value in the column "mysecondvalue" from the lookup table,
and putting it into my PQ results in a field named "matching_value_in_existing_query"
