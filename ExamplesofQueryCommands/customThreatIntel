Step 1: Ingest your TI

option 1 - ingest them as logs using the SentinelOne Collector, HEC, etc. For example, here is a document for how to ingest Threat Intelligence from Recorded Future: https://app.scalyr.com/solutions/import-recordedfuture

option 2 - import them as a datatable, which can then be used for lookups in queries

__________________________

Step 2:

make sure you  have a parser that will parse the threat intel. in our example you are doing so with a parser named 'intel' and generating fields ThreatIntel.type, ThreatIntel.Family, and sha256, with the example values below

ThreatIntel.type, ThreatIntel.Family, sha256
Ransomware, Ryuk, 2047bb9f00b16a6c8afba9f9a59ca4173a644b6cxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

____________________________________

Step 3: 

perform a join query on the actual data and these threat intel logs in order to generate a result

here is an example:

| join

intel = {

ThreatIntel.Type="Ransomware", ThreatIntel.Family="Ryuk", sha256=*
| let tgt.file.sha256=sha256
| columns ThreatIntel.type, ThreatIntel.Family, tgt.file.sha256
},

my_logs={ 
tgt.file.sha256=* | group count() by tgt.file.sha256, endpoint.name
}

on tgt.file.sha256

This should result in a table of any matches, which will have the fields

tgt.file.sha256, endpoint.name, ThreatIntel.type, ThreatIntel.family

_______________

now turn it into an alert

option A: use an SDL alert and simply copy the query in. In this case you can just set it to trigger for number of rows >0 since we care about all hits

option B: create a PQ monitor using this query to create a new table / log source with something like logfile="TI_Evals"

and then create a STAR rule querying for logfile="TI_Evals"
